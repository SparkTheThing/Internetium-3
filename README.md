# Internetium 3
This is the source code of Internetium's latest beta, which is a ~~Internet Explorer fork~~ browser made with Visual Studio 2010. 

# Wait, Where's the Pre-Built Executable?
There's none (yet) but If you want to, you can compile it yourself by using any version of VS2010 and after

# Is it open source?
Wait, You expect NOT to be? you can try to fork to create your own browser that is like Internetium. Originally written for Ranvir Singh aka Th1n by BasicallyMachine, with some ideas. Like adding Escargot to ~~toolbar~~ a menu, ~~tabs~~ It's Broken!

# What browser it's based on?
~~It's based on Internet Explorer, based on WebBrowser built in control on VS.~~ You can take a wild guess! Yes it's VBBrowser using a old IE version. 

# How can I compile?
JUST USE VS2010 and HIGHER, DUMMY :D

# Can I contact you via Discord?
Yes, I might be busy but... @ps7ll743
